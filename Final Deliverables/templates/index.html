        <h2>Crude Oil Price Prediction</h2>
        <p>Demand for oil is inelastic, therefore the rise in price is good news for producers because they will see an increase in their
        revenue. Oil importers, however, will experience increased costs of purchasing oil. Because oil is the largest traded 
        commodity, the effects are quite significant. A rising oil price can even shift economic/political power from oil importers to 
        oil exporters. The crude oil price movements are subject to diverse influencing factors.</p>
